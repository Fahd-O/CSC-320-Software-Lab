# CSC 320 Software Lab Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains my CSC320 Software Lab Project, a core course from my third year in university. Although it was assigned as a group project with three members, I completed the entire development independently, with my group members contributing only by testing the final product.

The goal was to build a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Computer-Based Test (CBT) web application featuring a Fingerprint Biometric Login System. Unfortunately, due to hardware limitations, software constraints, limited knowledge, and time constraints, the fingerprint login feature was not fully implemented. However, a fully functional MCQ CBT application was successfully developed.

This project evolved through four versions:

- **Frontend Prototype**: The initial version was a frontend-only prototype, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Version 1**: A complete MCQ CBT application with full functionality.
- **Version 2**: Added a login/sign-up system to enhance user access control.
- **Version 3**: Involved code and folder restructuring for better organization and maintainability.

The technologies used in this project (PHP, CSS, JavaScript, HTML) were selected based on available resources and commonly used tools. Tutorial videos on YouTube were instrumental in guiding and customizing the application to meet project requirements.

This project was completed between **January 2022 and November 2022**.

## Learning Goals

This project aimed to:

- Create a Computer Based Test (CBT)
- Have a fingerprint biometric login system in place for taking exams
- Uniquely save students' grades to database
- Have a signup mechanism in place to register new students
- Make it simple and aesthetic

## Features

- Robust login system
- Simple aesthetic appearance
- grade storage to database

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JS**
- **PHP**
- **MySQL**
- **XAMPP**

## Challenges and Solutions

Time constraint, lack of resources, insufficient knowledge, lack of support and tutor direction.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Alternatively, you can view the deployed projects via GitHub Pages.

## Future Improvements

No further updates are planned as this repository serves as an archive of coursework.
