# CSC 320 Software Lab Project

## Project Overview

Here is my CSC320 Software Lab Project repo. It was a group work and our project was to build a working Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Computer Based Test (CBT) Web App with a Fingerprint Biometric Login System... Sadly the we (or should I say "I". A single person ended up doing the work a group.) were able to build a working MCQ web app but couldn't achieve the fingerprint biometric login part.

This project was completed between **November 2022 and March 2023**.

Four versions of the project were developed. One is just frontend and the three other iterations are fullsatack.
